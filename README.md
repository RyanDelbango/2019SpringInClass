 Hello, my name is Ryan Delbango. I am a second semester graduate student in the Computer Science department at SUNY New Paltz. My undergraduate major was in Geology and it is also from SUNY New Paltz. I am relatively new to the computer science field, but my interest in the field continues to grow each day. My first exposure to the field was in my last semester of undergraduate when I took a class called Computational Media as an elective. During that class I learned to use the programming language processing to create interactive animations. During my first semester as a graduate student I took three courses: Programming and Data Structures, Computer Systems, and Database Design. In Programming and Data Structures, I worked with programming in JAVA and learned many concepts behind object oriented programming such as working with recursion and different data structures; learning each structures particular usefulness along the way. Throughout the course we created programs such as an Infix Calculator using stacks and an Airport Simulation using elements of randomness and queues, as well as many more projects. In computer systems we learned to work with assembly language and microprogramming. We learned on a simulation of the h1 computer. In Database Design, we learned the many different concepts about the process of creating a database. We learned about using crows foot diagrams to organize our thoughts, getting the database to third normal form, authoring SQL queries, and working  with My SQL. 

 I am interested in getting into the field of Data Science, and I believe the knowledge I will learn in this class will help me understand how applications work to retrieve and organize data. If I can understand how the systems behind these web applications work to store information, then I can better understand the usefulness of that information and curate the information that matters most more easily. I have also garnered an interest in programming and development in general after my first semester as a graduate student. I am still trying to figure out exactly where I fit in, in the computer science field. So maybe I will work on full stack development with a future job. I am trying to gain as much knowledge as possible, so I can better understand what I want out of a career in the field. Thank you, I look forward to the course.
